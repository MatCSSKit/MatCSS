# Grid System

For the grid system, we recommend using Bootstrap's grid system. It is simple, easy to use and easy to customize.

Bootstrap's grid system is based on flexbox. It is a 12 column grid system. You can use the `col` class to create columns. You can also use the `row` class to create rows. It is a powerful grid system that can be used to create any layout rapidly.

Note: The grid system is not required to use MatCSS. You can use any grid system you want, but we recommend using Bootstrap's grid system.

## Installation

Instead of installing the whole Bootstrap library, you can install only the grid system. This will reduce the size of your website and make it faster to load.

To install the grid system, you can add the following code to your HTML file:

```html
<link href="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-grid.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

This will add the grid system to your website.

## Usage

For more information on how to use the grid system, you can visit the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/).
