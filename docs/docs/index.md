# Introduction

MatCSS is a CSS framework built with the idea of smooth, pretty and simple components. It is designed to be easy to learn and to customize.

(explain that it was inspired by Bootstrap and Flatify)

MatCSS is inspired by [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Flatify](https://flatifycss.com/) (Go check them out, they're awesome!). Bootstrap has awesome utilities class that makes it easy to create a responsive website, we wanted to achieve a similar result with MatCSS, so we based our grid system on Bootstrap's! So if you are familiar with Bootstrap's grid system, you will feel right at home with MatCSS. Flatify had a unique style, inspired on Duolingo's website, that we really liked. We created components with similar styling and *vibe* to Flatify's, but with our own __twist__.

## Components

MatCSS has a lot of components, from buttons to cards, from dropdowns to modals. We have a lot of components that you can use to create your website. Be sure to check them out!

## Utilities

MatCSS has a lot of utilities classes that you can use to style your website. From colors to spacing, from text to flexbox, we have a lot of utilities that you can use to style your website. 

## Responsive Design

MatCSS is designed to be responsive. Using a system similar to Bootstrap's, we have a grid system that makes it easy to create a responsive website. 
 
## Customization

MatCSS is customizable in many ways! Using CSS variables, you can change the colors of the components, the spacing, the font, and much more! Everything you need to know about customization is at the bottom of every component's page! You may also customize the whole framework and customizing your _variables.scss file. Then you'll be able to build your very own version of MatCSS, with your name on it!
